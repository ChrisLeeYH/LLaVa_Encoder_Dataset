We are interested in people's responses to pictures representing a wide spectrum of situations. You will be looking at color photographs. Your task will be to evaluate each photograph on six 7-point scales (1 = I do not feel it at all (represents total absence of the given emotion); 7 = I feel it very strongly (represents the highest intensity of the emotion): A. Happiness; B. Surprise; C. Sadness; D. Anger; E. Disgust; F. Fear. Start each answer with a number. Also, please describe how you feel while viewing the picture: G. Arousal (1 = I feel completely unaroused or calm, and 9 = I feel completely aroused or excited); H. valence scale (1 = I feel completely unhappy or annoyed, and 9 = I feel completely happy or satisfied). There are no right or wrong answers; respond as honestly as you can. Start each answer with a number.
